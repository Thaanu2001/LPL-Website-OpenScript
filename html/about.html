        <p class="card-text">The Lanka Premier League (LPL) (Sinhala: ලංකා ප්‍රිමියර් ලීග්) is a professional Twenty20
            cricket league in Sri Lanka to be contested every year by teams representing Sri Lankan cities from 2020.
            The league was founded by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) in 2018.<br /><br />Originally, the first season was
            supposed to be held from 18 August to 10 September 2018, but postponed multiple times due to administrative
            issues within SLC. In June 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, SLC announced the tournament would start on
            28 August 2020, with 70 overseas players showing interest in playing in the league. However, it was
            announced that the tournament will be started on 21st of November 2020.</p>
